      "Context: adaptation of the endosymbiont to the host's lifestyle leads to many changes in the endosymbiont – the foremost being drastic reduction in its genome size. this is due to many genes being lost during the process of metabolism, and dna repair and recombination. while important genes participating in the dna to rna transcription, protein translation and dna / rna replication are retained. that is, a decrease in genome size is due to loss of protein coding genes and not due to lessening of inter - genic regions or open reading frame ( orf ) size. thus, species that are naturally evolving and contain reduced sizes of genes can be accounted for an increased number of noticeable differences between them, thereby leading to changes in their evolutionary rates. as the endosymbiotic bacteria related with these insects are passed on to the offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission, intracellular bacteria goes through many hurdles during the process, resulting in the decrease in effective population sizes when compared to the free living bacteria. this incapability of the endosymbiotic bacteria to reinstate its wild type phenotype via a recombination process is called as muller's ratchet phenomenon. muller's ratchet phenomenon together with less effective population sizes has led to an accretion of deleterious mutations in the non - essential genes of the intracellular bacteria. this could have been due to lack of selection mechanisms prevailing in the rich environment of the host.\n",

      "Context: the universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch. at standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non - toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula h2. since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non - metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic compounds. hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid – base reactions as many acid - base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. in ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge ( i. e., anion ) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged ( i. e., cation ) species denoted by the symbol h +. the hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest. as the only neutral atom for which the schrodinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.\n",

      "Context: most animals indirectly use the energy of sunlight by eating plants or plant - eating animals. most plants use light to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other biomolecules, characteristically containing reduced carbon in the form of carbon - hydrogen bonds. starting with carbon dioxide ( co2 ) and water ( h2o ), photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy in the form of simple sugars ( e. g., glucose ), with the release of molecular oxygen. these sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth, including the production of other biomolecules. when an animal eats plants ( or eats other animals which have eaten plants ), the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal. they are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for motion.\n",

      "Context: during the cenozoic era, specifically about 25 million years ago during the miocene and pliocene epochs, the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. the grasslands provided a new niche for mammals, including many ungulates and glires, that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. traditionally, the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked. however, an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals, giving rise to the \" grit, not grass \" hypothesis.\n",

      "Context: chickens are medium - sized, chunky birds with an upright stance and characterised by fleshy red combs and wattles on their heads. males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, and have more exaggerated plumage than females ( hens ). chickens are gregarious, omnivorous, ground - dwelling birds that in their natural surroundings search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals. they seldom fly except as a result of perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached. today's domestic chicken ( gallus gallus domesticus ) is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of asia, with some additional input from grey junglefowl. domestication is believed to have taken place between 7, 000 and 10, 000 years ago, and what are thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern china dated to around 5, 400 bc. archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting, the male bird being a doughty fighter. by 4, 000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the indus valley and 250 years later, they arrived in egypt. they were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. the romans used them in divination, and the egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of artificial incubation. since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat.\n",

      "Context: mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. light - dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. these selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. one final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. the genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by : 1 ) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2 ) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. however, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to learn about how these genes are expressed.\n",

      "Question: the ratio between the diameter and square root of the aperture is called what?\n",
      "Context: film speed is used in the exposure equations to find the appropriate exposure parameters. four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect : lighting, film speed, f - number ( aperture size ), and shutter speed ( exposure time ). the equation may be expressed as ratios, or, by taking the logarithm ( base 2 ) of both sides, by addition, using the apex system, in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure ; this increment is commonly known as a \" stop \". the effective f - number is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter, the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area. thus, a lens set to f / 1. 4 allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f / 2. therefore, each f - number factor of the square root of two ( approximately 1. 4 ) is also a stop, so lenses are typically marked in that progression : f / 1. 4, 2, 2. 8, 4, 5. 6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, etc.\n",

      "Context: despite efforts to revive hebrew as the national language of the jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by jews worldwide and english has emerged as the lingua franca of the jewish diaspora. although many jews once had sufficient knowledge of hebrew to study the classic literature, and jewish languages like yiddish and ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most jews lack such knowledge today and english has by and large superseded most jewish vernaculars. the three most commonly spoken languages among jews today are hebrew, english, and russian. some romance languages, particularly french and spanish, are also widely used. yiddish has been spoken by more jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the holocaust and the adoption of modern hebrew by the zionist movement and the state of israel. in some places, the mother language of the jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. for example, in quebec, the ashkenazic majority has adopted english, while the sephardic minority uses french as its primary language. similarly, south african jews adopted english rather than afrikaans. due to both czarist and soviet policies, russian has superseded yiddish as the language of russian jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. today, russian is the first language for many jewish communities in a number of post - soviet states, such as ukraine and uzbekistan, as well as for ashkenazic jews in azerbaijan, georgia, and tajikistan. although communities in north africa today are small and dwindling, jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one ( or nearly so ), speaking french in algeria, morocco, and the city of tunis, while most north africans continue to use arabic as their mother tongue.

      "Context: a pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are republicanism ( or neo - or civic - republicanism ) and the capability approach. the resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from isaiah berlin's positive and negative forms of liberty, namely \" liberty as non - domination. \" unlike liberals who understand liberty as \" non - interference, \" \" non - domination \" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of anyother person. to a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with may be free, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. prominent republicans include historian quentin skinner, jurist cass sunstein, and political philosopher philip pettit. the capability approach, pioneered by economists mahbub ul haq and amartya sen and further developed by legal scholar martha nussbaum, understands freedom under allied lines : the real - world ability to act. both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. in other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.\n",

      "Context: the term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. the primary metal is called the base, the matrix, or the solvent. the secondary constituents are often called solutes. if there is a mixture of only two types of atoms, not counting impurities, such as a copper - nickel alloy, then it is called a binary alloy. if there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a ternary alloy. an alloy with four constituents is a quaternary alloy, while a five - part alloy is termed a quinary alloy. because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a system. in this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a binary system, while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ternary system.\n",

      "Context: at a certain temperature, ( usually between 1, 500 °f ( 820 °c ) and 1, 600 °f ( 870 °c ), depending on carbon content ), the base metal of steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix, called allotropy. this allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal, diffusing into the iron matrix. when this happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in solution, or mixed with the iron, forming a single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called austenite. if the steel is cooled slowly, the iron will gradually change into its low temperature allotrope. when this happens the carbon atoms will no longer be soluble with the iron, and will be forced to precipitate out of solution, nucleating into the spaces between the crystals. the steel then becomes heterogeneous, being formed of two phases ; the carbon ( carbide ) phase cementite, and ferrite. this type of heat treatment produces steel that is rather soft and bendable. however, if the steel is cooled quickly the carbon atoms will not have time to precipitate. when rapidly cooled, a diffusionless ( martensite ) transformation occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. this causes the iron crystals to deform intrinsically when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, making it very hard and brittle.\n",

      "Context: when a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism. the relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. when the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. this is called a substitutional alloy. examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms. with the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. the smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the interstices. this is referred to as an interstitial alloy. steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms.\n",

      "Context: scientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of lamarck and the vague \" law of development \" of vestiges had not found scientific favour. darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. his strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of john stuart mill's a system of logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of william whewell's philosophy of the inductive sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. early support for darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including joseph dalton hooker in 1860, and asa gray in 1862. henry walter bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. alfred russel wallace discussed evidence from his malay archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the wallace line.\n",

      "Context: in january 1938, milt gabler started recording for his new label, commodore records, and to allow for longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12 - inch records. eddie condon explained : \" gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development. \" the first two 12 - inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length : \" carnegie drag \" was 3 : 15 ; \" carnegie jump \", 2 : 41. but at the second session, on april 30, the two 12 - inch recordings were longer : \" embraceable you \" was 4 : 05 ; \" serenade to a shylock \", 4 : 32. another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record. vaudeville stars gallagher and shean recorded \" mr. gallagher and mr. shean \", written by irving and jack kaufman, as two sides of a 10 - inch 78 in 1922 for cameo. an obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records. an early multi - record release was in 1903, when hmv in england made the first complete recording of an opera, verdi's ernani, on 40 single - sided discs. in 1940, commodore released eddie condon and his band's recording of \" a good man is hard to find \" in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12 - inch 78s. this limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the lp record, in 1948. in popular music, this time limitation of about 3 : 30 on a 10 - inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record. one exception is frank sinatra's recording of rodgers and hammerstein's \" soliloquy \", from carousel, made on may 28, 1946. because it ran 7 : 57, longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10 - inch record, it was released on columbia's masterwork label ( the classical division ) as two sides of a 12 - inch record. the same was true of john raitt's performance of the song on the original cast album of carousel, which had been issued on a 78 - rpm album set by american decca in 1945.\n",

      "Context: the united states has become essentially a two - party system. since a conservative ( such as the republican party ) and liberal ( such as the democratic party ) party has usually been the status quo within american politics. the first parties were called federalist and republican, followed by a brief period of republican dominance before a split occurred between national republicans and democratic republicans. the former became the whig party and the latter became the democratic party. the whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new republican party, as did anti - slavery members of the democratic party. third parties ( such as the libertarian party ) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win ( such as theodore roosevelt in the election of 1912 and george wallace in the election of 1968 ). as third party movements have learned, the electoral college's requirement of a nationally distributed majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed. thus, such parties rarely win many electoral votes, although their popular support within a state may tip it toward one party or the other. wallace had weak support outside the south. more generally, parties with a broad base of support across regions or among economic and other interest groups, have a great chance of winning the necessary plurality in the u. s.'s largely single - member district, winner - take - all elections. the tremendous land area and large population of the country are formidable challenges to political parties with a narrow appeal.\n",

[ citation needed ] other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later american developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. they criticize the marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. the non - marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. this view comes through in the book doing cultural studies : the story of the sony walkman ( by paul du gay et al. ), which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. feminist cultural analyst, theorist and art historian griselda pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. the writer julia kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical french feminism.

      "Context: as muslim institutions of higher learning, the madrasa had the legal designation of waqf. in central and eastern islamic lands, the view that the madrasa, as a charitable endowment, will remain under the control of the donor ( and their descendent ), resulted in a \" spurt \" of establishment of madaris in the 11th and 12th centuries. however, in western islamic lands, where the maliki views prohibited donors from controlling their endowment, madaris were not as popular. unlike the corporate designation of western institutions of higher learning, the waqf designation seemed to have led to the exclusion of non - orthodox religious subjects such a philosophy and natural science from the curricula. the madrasa of al - qarawiyin, one of the two surviving madaris that predate the founding of the earliest medieval universities and are thus claimed to be the \" first universities \" by some authors, has acquired official university status as late as 1947. the other, al - azhar, did acquire this status in name and essence only in the course of numerous reforms during the 19th and 20th century, notably the one of 1961 which introduced non - religious subjects to its curriculum, such as economics, engineering, medicine, and agriculture. it should also be noted that many medieval universities were run for centuries as christian cathedral schools or monastic schools prior to their formal establishment as universitas scholarium ; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the university dates back to the 6th century ad, thus well preceding the earliest madaris. george makdisi, who has published most extensively on the topic concludes in his comparison between the two institutions :\n",

      "Context: although ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an islamic centre for spiritual learning. \" the goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of god. \" religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. as inalcık mentions : \" those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad. \" however, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \" the ulema of the ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths \" – key word being \" divine \". inalcık also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of islam. \" hence, madaris – schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the ottoman world. although scholars such as goffman have argued that the ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around islam. similarly, in europe \" jewish children learned the hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the torah. \" wiesner - hanks also says that protestants also wanted to teach \" proper religious values. \" this shows that in the early modern period, ottomans and europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. thus, ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools in the sense that they offered a wide range of studies ; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate islamic practices and theories.\n",

      "Context: from his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. the parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his caltech colleague murray gell - mann. the relationship between the two models was murky ; gell - mann referred to feynman's partons derisively as \" put - ons \". in the mid - 1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the omega - minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. the stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to ernest rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) contained point - like particles that scattered electrons. it was natural to identify these with quarks, but feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. for example, the data showed that some 45 % of the energy momentum was carried by electrically - neutral particles in the nucleon. these electrically - neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three - valued color quantum number that solves the omega - minus problem. feynman did not dispute the quark model ; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.\n",

      "Context: georgian succeeded the english baroque of sir christopher wren, sir john vanbrugh, thomas archer, william talman, and nicholas hawksmoor ; this in fact continued into at least the 1720s, overlapping with a more restrained georgian style. the architect james gibbs was a transitional figure, his earlier buildings are baroque, reflecting the time he spent in rome in the early 18th century, but he adjusted his style after 1720. major architects to promote the change in direction from baroque were colen campbell, author of the influential book vitruvius britannicus ( 1715 - 1725 ) ; richard boyle, 3rd earl of burlington and his protege william kent ; isaac ware ; henry flitcroft and the venetian giacomo leoni, who spent most of his career in england. other prominent architects of the early georgian period include james paine, robert taylor, and john wood, the elder. the european grand tour became very common for wealthy patrons in the period, and italian influence remained dominant, though at the start of the period hanover square, westminster ( 1713 on ), developed and occupied by whig supporters of the new dynasty, seems to have deliberately adopted german stylisic elements in their honour, especially vertical bands connecting the windows.\n",

      "Context: the fossil record indicates that birds are the last surviving dinosaurs, having evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs. true birds first appeared during the cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago. dna - based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the cretaceous – paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs. birds in south america survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. primitive bird - like dinosaurs that lie outside class aves proper, in the broader group avialae, have been found dating back to the mid - jurassic period. many of these early \" stem - birds \", such as archaeopteryx, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.\n",

      "Context: the nervous system is large relative to the bird's size. the most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight - related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis, new world vultures and tubenoses. the avian visual system is usually highly developed. water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. some species also have dual fovea. birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet ( uv ) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones. this allows them to perceive ultraviolet light, which is involved in courtship. birds have specialized light - sensing cells deep in their brains that respond to light without input from eyes or other sensory neurons. these photo - receptive cells in the hypothalamus are involved in detecting the longer days of spring, and thus regulate breeding activities.\n",

      "Context: many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. these migrations vary among the different groups. many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. these birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non - breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs. migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling. landbirds have a flight range of around 2, 500 km ( 1, 600 mi ) and shorebirds can fly up to 4, 000 km ( 2, 500 mi ), although the bar - tailed godwit is capable of non - stop flights of up to 10, 200 km ( 6, 300 mi ). seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters, which nest in new zealand and chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the north pacific off japan, alaska and california, an annual round trip of 64, 000 km ( 39, 800 mi ). other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route. albatrosses nesting in the southern ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.\n",

      "Question: what methods are highly sensitive, general and slow tests used to identify microorganisms?\n",
      "Context: serological methods are highly sensitive, specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms. these tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen. the antigen, usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent, is bound by the antibody. this binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways, dependent upon the test. for example, \" strep throat \" is often diagnosed within minutes, and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent, s. pyogenes, that is retrieved from a patients throat with a cotton swab. serological tests, if available, are usually the preferred route of identification, however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require refrigeration. some serological methods are extremely costly, although when commonly used, such as with the \" strep test \", they can be inexpensive.\n",

( 2005 ) found temperature to be the only statistically significant factor to impact hunter - gatherer tool kits. using temperature as a proxy for risk, collard et al.'s results suggest that environments with extreme temperatures pose a threat to hunter - gatherer systems significant enough to warrant increased variability of tools. these results support torrence's ( 1989 ) theory that risk of failure is indeed the most important factor in determining the structure of hunter - gatherer toolkits.\n",

      "Question: where was the teutonic order headquartered in 1309?\n",
      "Context: popes called for crusades to take place elsewhere besides the holy land : in spain, southern france, and along the baltic. the spanish crusades became fused with the reconquista of spain from the muslims. although the templars and hospitallers took part in the spanish crusades, similar spanish military religious orders were founded, most of which had become part of the two main orders of calatrava and santiago by the beginning of the 12th century. northern europe also remained outside christian influence until the 11th century or later, and became a crusading venue as part of the northern crusades of the 12th to 14th centuries. these crusades also spawned a military order, the order of the sword brothers. another order, the teutonic knights, although originally founded in the crusader states, focused much of its activity in the baltic after 1225, and in 1309 moved its headquarters to marienburg in prussia.\n",

      "Question: what are the minimal pairs called that minimal phonology studies?\n",
      "Context: an important part of traditional, pre - generative schools of phonology is studying which sounds can be grouped into distinctive units within a language ; these units are known as phonemes. for example, in english, the \" p \" sound in pot is aspirated ( pronounced [ pʰ ] ) while that in spot is not aspirated ( pronounced [ p ] ). however, english speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations ( allophones ) of the same phonological category, that is of the phoneme / p /. ( traditionally, it would be argued that if an aspirated [ pʰ ] were interchanged with the unaspirated [ p ] in spot, native speakers of english would still hear the same words ; that is, the two sounds are perceived as \" the same \" / p /. ) in some other languages, however, these two sounds are perceived as different, and they are consequently assigned to different phonemes. for example, in thai, hindi, and quechua, there are minimal pairs of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature ( two words can have different meanings but with the only difference in pronunciation being that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one ).\n",

      "Question: what is an example of \" noise \" that is filtered out through the interpretation processes?\n",
      "Context: fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development such as the formation of marcelia and fruiting bodies. fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote, plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. the biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they don't trigger the fungal organism to react. this implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. so far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity. behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non - self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non - related species, and even filter out \" noise \", i. e. similar molecules without biotic content.\n",

      "Context: emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. this is important because emotions are related to the anti - stress complex, with an oxytocin - attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems ( kurt kortschal 2013 ). these characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. information that is encoded in the dna sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. in the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1. 2 % of their genetic material has been modified. this suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of dna, including our behaviors. students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene - dependent behavioral phenotypes. in voles ( microtus spp. ) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system ( hammock & young 2005 ). another potential example with behavioral differences is the focp2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language ( vargha - khadem et al. 2005 ). its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200, 000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans ( enard et al. 2002 ). speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions.\n",

      "Question: between the english and scandinavian language, what elements were most different?\n",
      "Context: the strength of the viking influence on old english appears from the fact that the indispensable elements of the language - pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs ( like \" hence \" and \" together \" ), conjunctions and prepositions - show the most marked danish influence ; the best evidence of scandinavian influence appears in the extensive word borrowings for, as jespersen indicates, no texts exist in either scandinavia or in northern england from this time to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax. the change to old english from old norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character. old norse and old english resembled each other closely like cousins and with some words in common, they roughly understood each other ; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged. it is most “ important to recognize that in many words the english and scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. the body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. in the mixed population which existed in the danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost. ” this blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in “ simplifying english grammar. ”\n",

      "Context: prompted by legislation in various countries mandating increased bulb efficiency, new \" hybrid \" incandescent bulbs have been introduced by philips. the \" halogena energy saver \" incandescents can produce about 23 lm / w ; about 30 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents, by using a reflective capsule to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which it can be re - emitted as visible light. this concept was pioneered by duro - test in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29. 8 lm / w. more advanced reflectors based on interference filters or photonic crystals can theoretically result in higher efficiency, up to a limit of about 270 lm / w ( 40 % of the maximum efficacy possible ). laboratory proof - of - concept experiments have produced as much as 45 lm / w, approaching the efficacy of compact fluorescent bulbs.\n",

      "Question: how is kaolin placed inside a light bulb?\n",
      "Context: most light bulbs have either clear or coated glass. the coated glass bulbs have a white powdery substance on the inside called kaolin. kaolin, or kaolinite, is a white, chalky clay in a very fine powder form, that is blown in and electrostatically deposited on the interior of the bulb. it diffuses the light emitted from the filament, producing a more gentle and evenly distributed light. manufacturers may add pigments to the kaolin to adjust the characteristics of the final light emitted from the bulb. kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. other kinds of colored bulbs are also made, including the various colors used for \" party bulbs \", christmas tree lights and other decorative lighting. these are created by coloring the glass with a dopant ; which is often a metal like cobalt ( blue ) or chromium ( green ). neodymium - containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural - appearing light.\n",

      "Context: a variation of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament, but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat. the electrode then became incandescent, with the arc contributing little to the light produced. such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as microscopes. these arc lamps ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope. they provided the intense concentrated light of an arc lamp but were easier to operate. developed around 1915, these lamps were displaced by mercury and xenon arc lamps.\n",

      "Question: multiplying the brightness of a light by a factor and decreasing the exposure by the same factor causes what to change?\n",
      "Context: upon exposure, the amount of light energy that reaches the film determines the effect upon the emulsion. if the brightness of the light is multiplied by a factor and the exposure of the film decreased by the same factor by varying the camera's shutter speed and aperture, so that the energy received is the same, the film will be developed to the same density. this rule is called reciprocity. the systems for determining the sensitivity for an emulsion are possible because reciprocity holds. in practice, reciprocity works reasonably well for normal photographic films for the range of exposures between 1 / 1000 second to 1 / 2 second. however, this relationship breaks down outside these limits, a phenomenon known as reciprocity failure.\n",

      "Context: the first railways in thuringia had been built in the 1840s and the network of main lines was finished around 1880. by 1920, many branch lines had been built, giving thuringia one of the densest rail networks in the world before world war ii with about 2, 500 km of track. between 1950 and 2000 most of the branch lines were abandoned, reducing thuringia's network by half compared to 1940. on the other hand, most of the main lines were refurbished after 1990, resulting in improved speed of travel. the most important railway lines at present are the thuringian railway, connecting halle and leipzig via weimar, erfurt, gotha and eisenach with frankfurt and kassel and the saal railway from halle / leipzig via jena and saalfeld to nuremberg. the former has an hourly ice / ic service from dresden to frankfurt while the latter is served hourly by ice trains from berlin to munich. in 2017, a new high speed line will be opened, diverting long - distance services from these mid - 19th century lines. both ice routes will then use the erfurt – leipzig / halle high - speed railway, and the berlin - munich route will continue via the nuremberg – erfurt high - speed railway. only the segment west of erfurt of the frankfurt - dresden line will continue to be used by ice trains after 2017, with an increased line speed of 200 km / h ( currently 160 km / h ). erfurt's central station, which was completely rebuilt for this purpose in the 2000s ( decade ), will be the new connection between both ice lines. the most important regional railway lines in thuringia are the neudietendorf – ritschenhausen railway from erfurt to wurzburg and meiningen, the weimar – gera railway from erfurt to chemnitz, the sangerhausen – erfurt railway from erfurt to magdeburg, the gotha – leinefelde railway from erfurt to gottingen, the halle – kassel railway from halle via nordhausen to kassel and the leipzig – hof railway from leipzig via altenburg to zwickau and hof. most regional and local lines have hourly service, but some run only every other hour.\n",

      "Question: what must a species do in order to be classified as a predator?\n",
      "Context: in an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator ( an organism that is hunting ) feeds on its prey ( the organism that is attacked ). predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. other categories of consumption are herbivory ( eating parts of plants ), fungivory ( eating parts of fungi ), and detritivory ( the consumption of dead organic material ( detritus ) ). all these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer - resource systems. it can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. for example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. the key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. on the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \" donor \" organism ( s ).\n",

      "Context: grazing organisms may also kill their prey species, but this is seldom the case. while some herbivores like zooplankton live on unicellular phytoplankton and therefore, by the individualized nature of the organism, kill their prey, many only eat a small part of the plant. grazing livestock may pull some grass out at the roots, but most is simply grazed upon, allowing the plant to regrow once again. kelp is frequently grazed in subtidal kelp forests, but regrows at the base of the blade continuously to cope with browsing pressure. animals may also be'grazed'upon ; female mosquitos land on hosts briefly to gain sufficient proteins for the development of their offspring. starfish may be grazed on, being capable of regenerating lost arms.\n",

      "Question: in what pyramid position is an organism not preyed upon by any other predators?\n",
      "Context: predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. one way of classifying predators is by trophic level. organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers ; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels ( for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses ). a predator at the top of any food chain ( that is, one that is preyed upon by no organism ) is called an apex predator ; examples include the orca, sperm whale, anaconda, komodo dragon, tiger, lion, tiger shark, nile crocodile, and most eagles and owls — and even omnivorous humans and grizzly bears. an apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat, such as a dog among alligators, a skunk in the presence of the great horned owl immune to skunk spray, or a snapping turtle among jaguars ; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators, such as a domestic cat or a dog in some insular environments, can become an apex predator by default.\n",

      "Context: plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. chemicals obtained from the air, soil and water form the basis of all plant metabolism. the energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non - photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.\n",

      "Context: a public genome sequencing effort of cotton was initiated in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers. they agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. \" tetraploid \" means that cultivated cotton actually has two separate genomes within its nucleus, referred to as the a and d genomes. the sequencing consortium first agreed to sequence the d - genome relative of cultivated cotton ( g. raimondii, a wild central american cotton species ) because of its small size and limited number of repetitive elements. it is nearly one - third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton ( ad ), and each chromosome is only present once. [ clarification needed ] the a genome of g. arboreum would be sequenced next. its genome is roughly twice the size of g. raimondii's. part of the difference in size between the two genomes is the amplification of retrotransposons ( gorge ). once both diploid genomes are assembled, then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties. this strategy is out of necessity ; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes, the euchromatic dna sequences of the ad genomes would co - assemble and the repetitive elements of ad genomes would assembly independently into a and d sequences respectively. then there would be no way to untangle the mess of ad sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.\n",

      "Context: regarding the timing of german rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of maxim litvinov, whose jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by nazi germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with germany. stalin immediately directed molotov to \" purge the ministry of jews. \" given litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti - fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with france and britain, and pro - western orientation by the standards of the kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a soviet option of rapprochement with germany. [ f ] likewise, molotov's appointment served as a signal to germany that the ussr was open to offers. the dismissal also signaled to france and britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with germany. one british official wrote that litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock - absorber, while molotov's \" modus operandi \" was \" more truly bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan. \" carr argued that the soviet union's replacement of foreign minister litvinov with molotov on may 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with germany, but rather was stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the british and the french by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely molotov, to the foreign commissariat. historian albert resis stated that the litvinov dismissal gave the soviets freedom to pursue faster - paced german negotiations, but that they did not abandon british – french talks. derek watson argued that molotov could get the best deal with britain and france because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with germany. geoffrey roberts argued that litvinov's dismissal helped the soviets with british – french talks, because litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.\n",

      "Context: a capacitor ( originally known as a condenser ) is a passive two - terminal electrical component used to store electrical energy temporarily in an electric field. the forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors ( plates ) separated by a dielectric ( i. e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized ). the conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. the nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. instead, a capacitor stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field between its plates.\n",

      "Question: what is one factor that does not affect the breakdown voltage of the capacitor?\n",
      "Context: for air dielectric capacitors the breakdown field strength is of the order 2 to 5 mv / m ; for mica the breakdown is 100 to 300 mv / m ; for oil, 15 to 25 mv / m ; it can be much less when other materials are used for the dielectric. the dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kv. as the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high - voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. the breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts ; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short ( or relatively low resistance ) circuit. the results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy.\n",

      "Context: the renewal of learning in europe, that began with 12th century scholasticism, came to an end about the time of the black death, and the initial period of the subsequent italian renaissance is sometimes seen as a lull in scientific activity. the northern renaissance, on the other hand, showed a decisive shift in focus from aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences ( botany, anatomy, and medicine ). thus modern science in europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval : the protestant reformation and catholic counter - reformation ; the discovery of the americas by christopher columbus ; the fall of constantinople ; but also the re - discovery of aristotle during the scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same way that martin luther and john calvin questioned religious doctrine. the works of ptolemy ( astronomy ) and galen ( medicine ) were found not always to match everyday observations. work by vesalius on human cadavers found problems with the galenic view of anatomy.\n",

      "Context: richard sander claims that by artificially elevating minority students into schools they otherwise would not be capable of attending, this discourages them and tends to engender failure and high dropout rates for these students. for example, about half of black college students rank in the bottom 20 percent of their classes, black law school graduates are four times as likely to fail bar exams as are whites, and interracial friendships are more likely to form among students with relatively similar levels of academic preparation ; thus, blacks and hispanics are more socially integrated on campuses where they are less academically mismatched. he claims that the supposed \" beneficiaries \" of affirmative action – minorities – don't actually benefit and rather are harmed by the policy. sander's claims have been disputed, and his empirical analyses have been subject to substantial criticism. a group including some of the country's lead statistical methodologists told the supreme court that sander's analyses were sufficiently flawed that the court would be wise to ignore them entirely. at the same time many scholars have found that minorities gain substantially from affirmative action.\n",

      "Context: terry eastland, the author who wrote from ending affirmative action : the case for colorblind justice states, \" most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories : remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity \". eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self - doubt and entitlement in minorities. eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. libertarian economist thomas sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, affirmative action around the world : an empirical study. sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non - preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [ i. e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action ] to take advantage of group preference policies ; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group ( e. g., upper and middle class blacks ), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non - preferred groups ( e. g., poor white or asian ) ; that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non - preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole ; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well. : 115 – 147\n",

      "Context: chapter ix deals with the fact that the geologic record appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable transitional fossils expected from gradual changes. darwin borrowed charles lyell's argument in principles of geology that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time ; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. to show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he again cited principles of geology and other observations based on sedimentation and erosion, including an estimate that erosion of the weald had taken 300 million years. the initial appearance of entire groups of well developed organisms in the oldest fossil - bearing layers, now known as the cambrian explosion, posed a problem. darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. fossil evidence of pre - cambrian life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.\n",

      "Context: the 45 rpm discs also came in a variety known as extended play ( ep ), which achieved up to 10 – 15 minutes play at the expense of attenuating ( and possibly compressing ) the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. ep discs were cheaper to produce, and were used in cases where unit sales were likely to be more limited or to reissue lp albums on the smaller format for those people who had only 45 rpm players. lp albums could be purchased 1 ep at a time, with four items per ep, or in a boxed set with 3 eps or 12 items. the large center hole on 45s allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. eps were generally discontinued by the late 1950s in the u. s. as three - and four - speed record players replaced the individual 45 players. one indication of the decline of the 45 rpm ep is that the last columbia records reissue of frank sinatra songs on 45 rpm ep records, called frank sinatra ( columbia b - 2641 ) was issued on december 7, 1959. the ep lasted considerably longer in europe, and was a popular format during the 1960s for recordings by artists such as serge gainsbourg and the beatles.\n",

      "Context: through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, various methods to improve the dynamic range of mass - produced records involved highly advanced disc cutting equipment. these techniques, marketed, to name two, as the cbs discomputer and teldec direct metal mastering, were used to reduce inner - groove distortion. rca victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of dynagroove. two main elements were combined : another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise. sometimes this was called \" diaphragming \" the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects. both elements were reflected in the brandname of dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. it also used the earlier advanced method of forward - looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk. lower recorded volume used closer spacing ; higher recorded volume used wider spacing, especially with lower frequencies. also, the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end farther away from the disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further.\n",

      "Context: the mid - 1970s saw the introduction of dbx - encoded records, again for the audiophile niche market. these were completely incompatible with standard record playback preamplifiers, relying on the dbx compandor encoding / decoding scheme to greatly increase dynamic range ( dbx encoded disks were recorded with the dynamic range compressed by a factor of two in db : quiet sounds were meant to be played back at low gain and loud sounds were meant to be played back at high gain, via automatic gain control in the playback equipment ; this reduced the effect of surface noise on quiet passages ). a similar and very short - lived scheme involved using the cbs - developed \" cx \" noise reduction encoding / decoding scheme.\n",

      "Question: what do most automatic turn tables do when they meet a lock groove?\n",
      "Context: towards the center, at the end of the groove, there is another wide - pitched section known as the lead - out. at the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a complete circle, called the lock groove ; when the stylus reaches this point, it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record. on some recordings ( for example sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band by the beatles, super trouper by abba and atom heart mother by pink floyd ), the sound continues on the lock groove, which gives a strange repeating effect. automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm, as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove, to trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record. precisely because of this mechanism, most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the lock groove, since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove.\n",

      "Context: it was not unusual for electric recordings to be played back on acoustic phonographs. the victor orthophonic phonograph was a prime example where such playback was expected. in the orthophonic, which benefited from telephone research, the mechanical pickup head was redesigned with lower resonance than the traditional mica type. also, a folded horn with an exponential taper was constructed inside the cabinet to provide better impedance matching to the air. as a result, playback of an orthophonic record sounded like it was coming from a radio.\n",

      "Question: what was a major cause of declined vinyl sales?\n",
      "Context: groove recordings, first designed in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century — withstanding competition from reel - to - reel tape, the 8 - track cartridge, and the compact cassette. in 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. first the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to cds and cassettes. record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. this rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to cds, which were more profitable for the record companies.\n",

      "Context: muslim sects regarded as heretical, such as the druze, ismailis, alevis, and alawites, ranked below jews and christians. in 1514, sultan selim i, nicknamed \" the grim \" because of his cruelty, ordered the massacre of 40, 000 anatolian alevis ( qizilbash ), whom he considered heretics, reportedly proclaiming that \" the killing of one alevi had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 christians. \" [ page needed ] selim was also responsible for an unprecedented and rapid expansion of the ottoman empire into the middle east, especially through his conquest of the entire mamluk sultanate of egypt, which included much of the region. with these conquests, selim further solidified the ottoman claim for being an islamic caliphate, although ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with murad i ( reigned 1362 to 1389 ). the caliphate would remain held by ottoman sultans for the rest of the office's duration, which ended with its abolition on 3 march 1924 by the grand national assembly of turkey and the exile of the last caliph, abdulmecid ii, to france.\n",

      "Context: statistically speaking, cable - borne elevators are extremely safe. their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. in 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent ( 1 in 12 million ) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. of the 20 to 30 elevator - related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance - related — for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. in fact, prior to the september 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free - fall incident in a modern cable - borne elevator happened in 1945 when a b - 25 bomber struck the empire state building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring ( though not killing ) the sole occupant — the elevator operator. however, there was an incident in 2007 at a seattle children's hospital, where a thyssenkrupp isis machine - room - less elevator free - fell until the safety brakes were engaged. this was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping ( or, in this case, a free - fall ). while it is possible ( though extraordinarily unlikely ) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free - falling and crashing. an elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 ( up to 12 or more in high rise installations ) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty - five percent more weight. in addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed ; if this happens, the device causes copper ( or silicon nitride in high rise installations ) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. this device is called the governor,\n",

      "Context: most languages today, even in countries that have no direct link to greco - roman culture, use some variant of the name \" neptune \" for the planet. however, in chinese, japanese, and korean, the planet's name was translated as \" sea king star \" ( 海 王 星 ), because neptune was the god of the sea. in mongolian, neptune is called dalain van ( далаин ван ), reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the sea. in modern greek the planet is called poseidon ( ποσειδωνας, poseidonas ), the greek counterpart of neptune. in hebrew, \" rahab \" ( רהב ), from a biblical sea monster mentioned in the book of psalms, was selected in a vote managed by the academy of the hebrew language in 2009 as the official name for the planet, even though the existing latin term \" neptun \" ( נפטון ) is commonly used. in maori, the planet is called tangaroa, named after the maori god of the sea. in nahuatl, the planet is called tlaloccitlalli, named after the rain god tlaloc.\n",

      "Question: what type of electric power garantees lesser loss?\n",
      "Context: there has, however, been interest among railroad operators in returning to dc use at higher voltages than previously used. at the same voltage, dc often has less loss than ac, and for this reason high - voltage direct current is already used on some bulk power transmission lines. dc avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with ac, and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical emf risks. dc also avoids the power factor problems of ac. of particular interest to railroading is that dc can supply constant power with a single ungrounded wire. constant power with ac requires three - phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires. another important consideration is that mains - frequency 3 - phase ac must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads. parts of the system are supplied from different phases on the assumption that the total loads of the 3 phases will even out. at the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases, long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time. a few railroads have tried 3 - phase but its substantial complexity has made single - phase standard practice despite the interruption in power flow that occurs twice every cycle. an experimental 6 kv dc railway was built in the soviet union.\n",

      "Context: in other cities, class conflict was more evident. over a quarter of london's population had left the city by november 1940. civilians left for more remote areas of the country. upsurges in population south wales and gloucester intimated where these displaced people went. other reasons, including industry dispersal may have been a factor. however, resentment of rich self - evacuees or hostile treatment of poor ones were signs of persistence of class resentments although these factors did not appear to threaten social order. the total number of evacuees numbered 1. 4 million, including a high proportion from the poorest inner - city families. reception committees were completely unprepared for the condition of some of the children. far from displaying the nation's unity in time of war, the scheme backfired, often aggravating class antagonism and bolstering prejudice about the urban poor. within four months, 88 % of evacuated mothers, 86 % of small children, and 43 % of school children had been returned home. the lack of bombing in the phoney war contributed significantly to the return of people to the cities, but class conflict was not eased a year later when evacuation operations had to be put into effect again.\n",

      "Context: while outer space provides the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum, the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called aether. borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of stoic physics, aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, ( see aether ( mythology ) ). early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. additionally, the concept informed isaac newton's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat. 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the earth's orbit. while the earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. in 1912, astronomer henry pickering commented : \" while the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, [ it ] is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there \".\n",

      "Question: what caused the resurface of the grecian monotony in politics?\n",
      "Context: a distinct greek political identity re - emerged in the 11th century in educated circles and became more forceful after the fall of constantinople to the crusaders of the fourth crusade in 1204, so that when the empire was revived in 1261, it became in many ways a greek national state. that new notion of nationhood engendered a deep interest in the classical past culminating in the ideas of the neoplatonist philosopher gemistus pletho, who abandoned christianity. however, it was the combination of orthodox christianity with a specifically greek identity that shaped the greeks'notion of themselves in the empire's twilight years. the interest in the classical greek heritage was complemented by a renewed emphasis on greek orthodox identity, which was reinforced in the late medieval and ottoman greeks'links with their fellow orthodox christians in the russian empire. these were further strengthened following the fall of the empire of trebizond in 1461, after which and until the second russo - turkish war of 1828 - 29 hundreds of thousands of pontic greeks fled or migrated from the pontic alps and armenian highlands to southern russia and the russian south caucasus ( see also greeks in russia, greeks in armenia, greeks in georgia, and caucasian greeks ).\n",

      "Context: in the hesiodic catalogue of women, graecus is presented as the son of zeus and pandora ii, sister of hellen the patriarch of hellenes. hellen was the son of deucalion who ruled around phthia in central greece. the parian chronicle mentions that when deucalion became king of phthia, the previously called graikoi were named hellenes. aristotle notes that the hellenes were related with grai / greeks ( meteorologica i. xiv ) a native name of a dorian tribe in epirus which was used by the illyrians. he also claims that the great deluge must have occurred in the region around dodona, where the selloi dwelt. however, according to the greek tradition it is more possible that the homeland of the greeks was originally in central greece. a modern theory derives the name greek ( latin graeci ) from graikos, \" inhabitant of graia / graea, \" a town on the coast of boeotia. greek colonists from graia helped to found cumae ( 900 bc ) in italy, where they were called graeces. when the romans encountered them they used this name for the colonists and then for all greeks ( graeci. ) the word γραια graia \" old woman \" comes from the pie root * gerh2 - / * greh2 -, \" to grow old \" via proto - greek * gera - / grau - iu ; the same root later gave γερας geras ( / keras / ), \" gift of honour \" in mycenean greek. the germanic languages borrowed the word greeks with an initial \" k \" sound which probably was their initial sound closest to the latin \" g \" at the time ( goth. kreks ). the area out of ancient attica including boeotia was called graike and is connected with the older deluge of ogyges, the mythological ruler of boeotia. the region was originally occupied by the minyans who were autochthonous or proto - greek speaking people. in ancient greek the name ogygios came to mean \" from earliest days \".\n",

      "Context: the exact causes and motivations for rome's military conflicts and expansions during the republic are subject to wide debate. while they can be seen as motivated by outright aggression and imperialism, historians typically take a much more nuanced view. they argue that rome's expansion was driven by short - term defensive and inter - state factors ( that is, relations with city - states and kingdoms outside rome's hegemony ), and the new contingencies that these decisions created. in its early history, as rome successfully defended itself against foreign threats in central and then northern italy, neighboring city - states sought the protection a roman alliance would bring. as such, early republican rome was not an \" empire \" or \" state \" in the modern sense, but an alliance of independent city - states ( similar to the greek hegemonies of the same period ) with varying degrees of genuine independence ( which itself changed over time ) engaged in an alliance of mutual self - protection, but led by rome. with some important exceptions, successful wars in early republican rome generally led not to annexation or military occupation, but to the restoration of the way things were. but the defeated city would be weakened ( sometimes with outright land concessions ) and thus less able to resist romanizing influences, such as roman settlers seeking land or trade with the growing roman confederacy. it was also less able to defend itself against its non - roman enemies, which made attack by these enemies more likely. it was, therefore, more likely to seek an alliance of protection with rome.\n",

      "Context: fearing the worst, the romans began a major mobilization, all but pulling out of recently pacified spain and gaul. they even established a major garrison in sicily in case the seleucids ever got to italy. this fear was shared by rome's greek allies, who had largely ignored rome in the years after the second macedonian war, but now followed rome again for the first time since that war. a major roman - greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the second punic war, scipio africanus, and set out for greece, beginning the roman - syrian war. after initial fighting that revealed serious seleucid weaknesses, the seleucids tried to turn the roman strength against them at the battle of thermopylae ( as they believed the 300 spartans had done centuries earlier ). like the spartans, the seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate greece. the romans pursued the seleucids by crossing the hellespont, which marked the first time a roman army had ever entered asia. the decisive engagement was fought at the battle of magnesia, resulting in a complete roman victory. the seleucids sued for peace, and rome forced them to give up their recent greek conquests. although they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the decline of their empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east ( the parthians ) and the west ( the greeks ). their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by pontus. following magnesia, rome again withdrew from greece, assuming ( or hoping ) that the lack of a major greek power would ensure a stable peace. in fact, it did the opposite.\n",

      "Context: in towns, which expanded greatly during the period, landowners turned into property developers, and rows of identical terraced houses became the norm. even the wealthy were persuaded to live in these in town, especially if provided with a square of garden in front of the house. there was an enormous amount of building in the period, all over the english - speaking world, and the standards of construction were generally high. where they have not been demolished, large numbers of georgian buildings have survived two centuries or more, and they still form large parts of the core of cities such as london, edinburgh, dublin and bristol.\n",

      "Context: internal courtyards became more rare, except beside the stables, and the functional parts of the building were placed at the sides, or in separate buildings nearby hidden by trees. the views to and from the front and rear of the main block were concentrated on, with the side approaches usually much less important. the roof was typically invisible from the ground, though domes were sometimes visible in grander buildings. the roofline was generally clear of ornament except for a balustrade or the top of a pediment. columns or pilasters, often topped by a pediment, were popular for ornament inside and out, and other ornament was generally geometrical or plant - based, rather than using the human figure.\n",

      "Context: beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics. he developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy. whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another. today whitehead's philosophical works – particularly process and reality – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.\n",

      "Context: in addition to numerous articles on mathematics, whitehead wrote three major books on the subject : a treatise on universal algebra ( 1898 ), principia mathematica ( co - written with bertrand russell and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913 ), and an introduction to mathematics ( 1911 ). the former two books were aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians, while the latter book was intended for a larger audience, covering the history of mathematics and its philosophical foundations. principia mathematica in particular is regarded as one of the most important works in mathematical logic of the 20th century.\n",

      "Question: what did whitehead believe about the concept of relations in the context of defining an entity?\n",
      "Context: in fact, whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities – its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it. a real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it ; that is to say, if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity ( i. e. it was not related to any other entity ), it could not be said to really exist. relations are not secondary to what a thing is, they are what the thing is.\n",

      "Context: it must be emphasized, however, that an entity is not merely a sum of its relations, but also a valuation of them and reaction to them. for whitehead, creativity is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity ( whether it is a human being, a tree, or an electron ) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities, and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws. of course, most entities don't have consciousness. as a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, the same can be said of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow. moreover, inability to predict an electron's movement ( for instance ) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology ; rather, the fundamental creativity / freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.\n",

      "Question: what did whitehead state are the two types of perception?\n",
      "Context: since whitehead's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience, he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living, self - conscious beings. the term he coined was \" prehension \", which comes from the latin prehensio, meaning \" to seize. \" the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious, applying to people as well as electrons. it is also intended to make clear whitehead's rejection of the theory of representative perception, in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities. for whitehead, the term \" prehension \" indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself. in this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them. further, whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, causal efficacy ( or \" physical prehension \" ) and presentational immediacy ( or \" conceptual prehension \" ).\n",

      "Context: native american music in north america is almost entirely monophonic, but there are notable exceptions. traditional native american music often centers around drumming. rattles, clappersticks, and rasps were also popular percussive instruments. flutes were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. the tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player, but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and, at least in northern california, a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. the apache fiddle is a single stringed instrument.\n",

      "Context: protestantism has had an important influence on science. according to the merton thesis, there was a positive correlation between the rise of english puritanism and german pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other. the merton thesis has two separate parts : firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology ; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th - century england and the religious demography of the royal society ( english scientists of that time were predominantly puritans or other protestants ) can be explained by a correlation between protestantism and the scientific values. merton focused on english puritanism and german pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. he explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic protestant values and those of modern science. protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify god's influence on the world — his creation — and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.\n",

      "Context: earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. the moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as the result of a mars - sized object with about 10 % of the earth's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow. some of this object's mass merged with the earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon. outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered from comets, produced the oceans.\n",

      "Context: the most - commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age, in the hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable greenhouse conditions typical of the ordovician. the ice age was probably not as long - lasting as once thought ; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0. 5 to 1. 5 million years. the event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( from 7000ppm to 4400ppm ) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. as the southern supercontinent gondwana drifted over the south pole, ice caps formed on it. evidence of these ice caps have been detected in upper ordovician rock strata of north africa and then - adjacent northeastern south america, which were south - polar locations at the time.\n",

      "Context: the remainder was the world - ocean known as panthalassa ( \" all the sea \" ). all the deep - ocean sediments laid down during the triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates ; thus, very little is known of the triassic open ocean. the supercontinent pangaea was rifting during the triassic — especially late in the period — but had not yet separated. the first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial break - up of pangea — which separated new jersey from morocco — are of late triassic age ; in the u. s., these thick sediments comprise the newark supergroup. because of the limited shoreline of one super - continental mass, triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare ; despite their prominence in western europe, where the triassic was first studied. in north america, for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. thus triassic stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as estheria crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates.\n",

      "Context: during the eocene ( 56 million years ago - 33. 9 million years ago ), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. at the beginning of the period, australia and antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. but when australia split from the southern continent around 45 ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. the antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. the present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.

      "Context: the last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10, 000 years ago. ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres ( 115 ft ) in the early part of the holocene. in addition, many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres ( 591 ft ) over the late pleistocene and holocene, and are still rising today. the sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. holocene marine fossils are known from vermont, quebec, ontario and michigan. other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain and cave deposits. holocene marine deposits along low - latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non - glacial origin. post - glacial rebound in scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the baltic sea, including much of finland. the region continues to rise, still causing weak earthquakes across northern europe. the equivalent event in north america was the rebound of hudson bay, as it shrank from its larger, immediate post - glacial tyrrell sea phase, to near its present boundaries.\n",

( however, notice that one also can make from these building blocks matter that is not atoms or molecules. ) then, because electrons are leptons, and protons, and neutrons are made of quarks, this definition in turn leads to the definition of matter as being quarks and leptons, which are the two types of elementary fermions. carithers and grannis state : ordinary matter is composed entirely of first - generation particles, namely the [ up ] and [ down ] quarks, plus the electron and its neutrino. ( higher generations particles quickly decay into first - generation particles, and thus are not commonly encountered. )\n",

      "Question: what kind of core does nuclear matter occur in?\n",
      "Context: strange matter is a particular form of quark matter, usually thought of as a liquid of up, down, and strange quarks. it is contrasted with nuclear matter, which is a liquid of neutrons and protons ( which themselves are built out of up and down quarks ), and with non - strange quark matter, which is a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks. at high enough density, strange matter is expected to be color superconducting. strange matter is hypothesized to occur in the core of neutron stars, or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from femtometers ( strangelets ) to kilometers ( quark stars ).\n",
